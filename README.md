# neuropower-validation

This folder contains the code that was used to validate neuropower.  There are three main ways the estimation procedure was validated:
- with simulations (files starting with "SIM")
- with the data from the human connectome project (files starting with "HCP")
- an example dataset from Seurinck et al. (files starting with "EXAMPLE")
